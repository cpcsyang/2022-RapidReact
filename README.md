## The Common Lib

*This all has to be ran in the terminal*

The first thing that you have to do when creating a new brach or bringing in the **Common Lib** is to run 

* git submodule update --init

That dosin't work you and you don't have a **Common** folder you can run 

* git submodule add https://github.com/FRCTeam2910/Common.git common


After that command is ran in the **cd common** into the common lib and run **gradlew build**.

Then **cd ..** out of the **common** directory and into the project directory.

Then run the **gradlew build** That will build the hole  project.

All of theys steps you can run in vscode **Build robot code**.
